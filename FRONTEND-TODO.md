## Completion Metrics

**Current Status:**
- Core Features: ~40% Complete
- Security: ~20% Complete  
- Testing: 0% Complete
- Performance: ~30% Complete
- Accessibility: ~10% Complete
- Documentation: ~5% Complete

**Estimated Time to Production:**
- Minimum Viable Product: 2-3 months
- Full Feature Set: 4-6 months
- Enterprise Ready: 6-9 months

**Risk Assessment:**
- ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Cannot launch without testing, error handling, and security fixes
- ðŸŸ¡ HIGH: Missing core features will severely impact user experience
- ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM: UX improvements needed but not blocking
- âšª LOW: Nice-to-have features can be added post-launch

## Next Steps Priority Order

1. **Week 1-2:** Set up testing infrastructure and write critical path tests
2. **Week 3-4:** Fix memory leaks and performance issues
3. **Week 5-6:** Implement error boundaries and proper error handling
4. **Week 7-8:** Complete core booking features
5. **Week 9-10:** Security audit and fixes
6. **Week 11-12:** Mobile responsiveness and accessibility
7. **Week 13+:** Performance optimization and remaining features

**Note:** This is a realistic assessment. The current frontend is NOT production-ready and shipping it as-is would be professional negligence.
